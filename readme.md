# GitHub Organization

I've created a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/CDSeattleMEAN201707) for this class.  Please create a repository in that organization with your name (so my repo is `jack_brounstein`) by clicking the green "New" button in the right-hand sidebar.  Each day, some assignments will be marked with **GitHub**; in addition to uploading those files to the platform, please also push them into your GitHub repo.  The hope is that this will help you become more familiar with using version control as well as make it convenient for me to check your progress at a glance.

Don't remember how to push things to GitHub?  Look up these commands:

* `git init`
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "some message"`
* `git push`

Don't have access to the organization?  Send me your GitHub username on Slack.

### Wednesday, July 5

OOP and advanced JavaScript: Callbacks, closures, immediate functions

We are mostly skipping the Node.js chapter--it explains in great detail how to run a web server with only Node, but for the rest of the course, we'll be using Express, which does the same thing but with much more convenient syntax.  However, make sure you read the "Node Modules" tab and complete the "Math Module" assignment.

## Week 2

### Monday, July 10

Modularization: Turning one giant server file into several smaller files

We'll also talk about using `express-session` to handle login/registration

1955 API might not seem like much, but it's actually a very important assignment.  If you can complete it, you'll have pretty much all you need on the server side for a MEAN app...which is good, because tomorrow we start dealing with the client side.

Assignments|
---|
Modularized Mongoose|
1955 API **GitHub**|

### Tuesday, July 11

Dojo Mall **GitHub**|
Retro Barcode Generator **GitHub**|

### Wednesday, July 12

Read Routing & Observables and Services, Promises, & HTTP.  Note that we'll be using the HTTP module tomorrow to make requests to our server once we have a full MEAN app.

In the afternoon, we'll build a custom pipe to filter an array of data

Assignments|
---|
GitHub Score **GitHub**|
Dojo Weather Forecast|
Project Product Management|


### Friday, July 14

[Bastille Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K1q9Ntcr5g)!  The Dojo is open.

Angular review + full MEAN!

When running a full MEAN application, we'll replace `ng serve` with `ng build -w` (and `nodemon server.js`, of course!)

Please note that the bulk of this chapter was written when we were still using Angular 1, so some of the specific code samples (anything client side, basically) no longer apply; use what we've learned to replicate the functionality that the platform describes.

Assignments|
---|
File Structure and Simple Server|
Friends API|
